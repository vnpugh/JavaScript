Favorite Books
In this assessment, I have created a list of 5 of my favorite books.
Dynamic HTML is used.
Each book is displayed in a Bootstrap card and includes the following:

*Cover Image
*Title
*A blue button titled "Show Description"

The "Show Description" button has the following functionality:

*When clicked and the button says "Show Description", the description for that book will be displayed in that bottom section, the text will be changed to "Hide Description" and the color of the button will be changed to red.  All other buttons that were not clicked should be changed to blue and say "Show Description"

*When clicked and the button says "Hide Description", the description will be removed from the bottom section, the text will be changed to "Show Description" and the color of the button will be changed to blue
